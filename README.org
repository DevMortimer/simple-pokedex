* Simple Pokedex
A simple GUI program made with iced-rs that shows details about a Pokemon. As of now, it shows the following:
- Name
- Description
- Sprite

** Why
Because I often play Pokemon games in my computer and I'd rather have a small window where I can search a Pokemon name and see what I need rather than open a browser.

** Screenshot
As of now, with name, description, and sprite it looks like:
